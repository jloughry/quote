`quote` a UNIX command line utility that simply quotes its input
================================================================

I needed this one day when feeding a string into the `date` command in
UNIX; there didn't seem to be any way to programmatically place a string in
quotation marks in the middle of a CLI pipeline.

Usage
-----

````
quote
````
